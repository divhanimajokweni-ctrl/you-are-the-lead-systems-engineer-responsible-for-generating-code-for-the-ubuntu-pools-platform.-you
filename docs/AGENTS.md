## 🎯 Contributor Onboarding & Meritocratic Recruitment

### The "Play-to-Contribute" Philosophy
Ubuntu Pools operates on **First Principles** thinking where contribution leads to trust, and trust leads to authority. Our recruitment pipeline uses the codebase as the interview — high-quality contributions earn recruitment consideration.

### 📋 How to Become a Contributor

#### **Step 1: Understand the Ubuntu Accord**
Before contributing, study our foundational principles:
- **Collective Prosperity**: Individual success serves community advancement
- **Trust Through Transparency**: All decisions are auditable and verifiable
- **Meritocratic Governance**: Authority earned through demonstrated competence
- **Data Sovereignty**: Users control their own information

#### **Step 2: Choose Your Contribution Path**
| Path | Difficulty | Impact | Time Commitment |
|------|------------|--------|-----------------|
| **🐛 Bug Fixes** | 🟢 Beginner | Medium | 2-4 hours |

## 📚 Optional Feature Guides

When users request features beyond the base template, check for available recipes in `.kilocode/recipes/`.

### Available Recipes

| Recipe       | File                                | When to Use                                           |
